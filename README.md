# Image Recreation by Genetic Algorithm

This project was created for a software engineering course 2S03 - Programming in C at McMaster University. The project implements a genetic algorithm to reproduce a given image from a portable pixmap (PPM) image populated with randomly generated pixels.

## Results

The image reconstruction process of M. C. Escher's _Sky and Water I_ is demonstrated below:
